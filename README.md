# Microcolonise

Analysis scripts associated with the paper 'Droplet printing reveals the importance of micron-scale structure for bacterial ecology'. The scripts are split into two folders:

## 2DAnalysis

Analyses that allow the automated registration of prints to the x-y coordinate space, removal of microcolonies far from the main print, generation of radial profiles and measurement of 2D microcolony features. To run, use the script `Do2DAnalyses.m`.

Please note that these analyses rely on performing segmentation and feature extraction with [FAST](https://github.com/Pseudomoaner/FAST).
